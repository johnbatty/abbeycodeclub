    What a great first Code Club! I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did. This week we: talked about why it is important and fun to learn about coding looked at how computers have changed in recent years, and thought about how they might change in future (nobody knows!) did some great programming of Minecraft and Disney Infinity Play Lab at code.org had a play with my super-colourful NeoPixel LED strip, controlled by a Microview microcontroller and a Wii Nunchuk hand controller I was really impressed with your enthusiasm and how much progress you all made in the programming exercises!  <a href="/post/codeclub-001/">Read More...</a>
