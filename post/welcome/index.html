<h1 id="welcome-to-abbey-code-club">Welcome to Abbey Code Club!</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about our brand new code club - the first ever code club at Abbey School.  I hope you are too!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much to read here at the moment, but I&rsquo;ll be updating the website regularly so check back often.</p>

<p>Code clubs will run every Tuesday afternoon 3:30-4:30 in the computer room.</p>

<p>To get started, here are some links to websites that you might find interesting!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk">Code Club</a></p>

<p>Home of all Code Clubs. There are nearly 5,000 clubs in the UK!</p>

<p>Lots of <a href="https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/">projects here</a>, some of which we will be doing in our Code Club.  Most of these projects need a passcode to access them.  If you are keen to try them out then tell me and I&rsquo;ll give you the magic code.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://code.org/learn">Code.org</a></p>

<p>The USA&rsquo;s version of Code Club!</p>

<p>There are some great &ldquo;Hour of code&rdquo; games here that are a fantastic way to get started with programming, including <a href="https://code.org/mc">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://code.org/starwars">Star Wars</a>, and <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/frozen/stage/1/puzzle/1">Frozen</a>.</p>

<p>Can you complete them all?!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=home">Scratch</a></p>

<p>The most popular way to write programs using graphical blocks.  A great place to start.  It means you don&rsquo;t have to type very much, and teaches you the main principles of computer programming.</p>

<p>There are instructions on the right hand side of the page to help you learn how to use it!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a></p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s favourite low-cost computer.  And it is British!</p>

<p>Have you got one?!  If so, tell me what you do with it&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk">BBC micro:bit</a></p>

<p>Another low cost &ldquo;wearable&rdquo; computer, recently release by the BBC (yes, the people who make the TV programs!).</p>

<p>Throught the generosity of Code Club, we are getting 4 of these, so I look forward to using them later in the term!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com">Pimoroni</a></p>

<p>A British company who started off making cases for Raspberry Pis, but have now grown into making their own electronics, and selling all sorts of add-ons.</p>

<p>Designers and makers of the fantastic <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimoroni/flotilla-for-raspberry-pi-making-for-everyone/description">Flotilla</a> electronics kit.  I&rsquo;ve got one of these, and we&rsquo;ll do something with it later in the year!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com">Adafruit</a></p>

<p>American maker of all sorts of cool electronic components.</p>

<p>Loads of <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com">great projects</a>!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com">SparkFun</a></p>

<p>Another American maker of all sorts of cool electronic components!  They have a large number of <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials">tutorials</a>.  Most of them are quite advanced electronics, but they might give you some ideas!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://makezine.com">Make:</a></p>

<p>A very respected American website on making all sorts of things - not just computer-related ones!</p>

<p>Lots of creative ideas here&hellip;!</p>
