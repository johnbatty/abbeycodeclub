<h1 id="welcome-to-abbey-code-club">Welcome to Abbey Code Club!</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about our brand new code club - the first ever code club at Abbey School.  I hope you are too!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much to read here at the moment, but I&rsquo;ll be updating the website regularly so check back often.</p>

<p>Code clubs will run every Tuesday afternoon 3:30-4:30 in the computer room.</p>

<p>To get started, here are some links to websites that you might find interesting!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk">Code Club</a></p>

<p>Home of all Code Clubs. There are nearly 5,000 clubs in the UK!</p>

<p>Lots of <a href="https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/">projects here</a>, some of which we will be doing in our Code Club.  Most of these projects need a passcode to access them.  If you are keen to try them out outside of Code Club then tell me and I&rsquo;ll give you the required code.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://code.org/learn">Code.org</a></p>

<p>An American organisation, whose mission is to teach children to code. Sounds like a good place for us to go!</p>

<p>There are some great &ldquo;Hour of Code&rdquo; games here that are a fantastic way to get started with programming, including <a href="https://code.org/mc">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://code.org/starwars">Star Wars</a>, and <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/frozen/stage/1/puzzle/1">Frozen</a>.</p>

<p>Can you complete them all?!</p>

<p>You should also watch some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfpD8i4Sx7U0y2MccnrNZuP">videos</a> - they have a lot of famous people in them, including Bill Gates (who started Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (who started Facebook) and Barack Obama (the USA president!). All of these people think it is really important for children to learn to code!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=home">Scratch</a></p>

<p>The most popular way to write programs using graphical blocks.  A great tool to start with.  It means you don&rsquo;t have to type very much, and teaches you the main principles of computer programming.</p>

<p>There are instructions on the right hand side of the page to help you learn how to use it!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a></p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s favourite low-cost computer.  And it is British!</p>

<p>Have you got one?!  If so, tell me what you do with it&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk">BBC micro:bit</a></p>

<p>A low cost &ldquo;wearable&rdquo; computer, recently released by the BBC (yes, the people who make TV programmes!).  Check out the <a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk/watch-video">video</a>.</p>

<p>Through the generosity of Code Club, we will shoortly be getting four of these, so I look forward to us using them later in the term!</p>

<p>If you want to get some practice in, you can follow a tutorial, write programs and run them on a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; micro:bit <a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-code">here</a>.  Tip: it will easiest if you start off using the Block Editor!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com">Pimoroni</a></p>

<p>A British company who started off making cases for Raspberry Pis, but have now grown into making their own electronics, and selling all sorts of add-ons.</p>

<p>Designers and makers of the fantastic <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimoroni/flotilla-for-raspberry-pi-making-for-everyone/description">Flotilla</a> electronics kit.  I&rsquo;ve got one of these, and we&rsquo;ll do something with it later in the year!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com">Adafruit</a></p>

<p>American designer and maker of all sorts of cool electronic components.</p>

<p>Loads of <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com">great projects</a>!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com">SparkFun</a></p>

<p>Another American maker of all sorts of cool electronic components!  They have a large number of <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials">tutorials</a>.  Most of them are quite advanced electronics, but they might give you some ideas!</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://makezine.com">Make:</a></p>

<p>A very established American website that covers making all sorts of things - not just computer-related ones!</p>

<p>Lots of super-creative ideas here&hellip;!</p>
